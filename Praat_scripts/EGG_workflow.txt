(1) Make two-channel EGG recordings

(2) Use prepare_audio_for_annotation.praat to extract and filter the audio channel (=channel 1) so that it's easier to label words.

(3) Annotate and label target words [RTB]

(4) Run forced-alignment or otherwise do segmental labelling for target segments and flanking segments

   - Before doing this, you need to extract + recombine or something the way you did with EGG_audio_signal_processing.praat. Alternatively, you should do this at stage (5), but it could bring in issues in stages (5) and/or (6). Be careful here.

(5) Hand-correct segment-level labeling

	(5a) Code stops for whether they are implosive vs. ejective? [Undergraduates]

(6) Using TextGrids finalized in (5), run EGG_audio_signal_processing.praat on the original audio files recorded in (1) (or whatever their recombined structure looks like)

(7) Use mark_EGG_extrema.praat to place EGG extrema on TextGrids, and mark_stop_releases.praat to add stop releases to stop intervals.

  - mark_EGG_extrema.praat should probably be changed so that it looks for extrema in the *derivative* of the signal instead, much like mark_stop_releases.praat does.

(8) Hand-correct EGG extrema and releases [Undergraduates]

(9) Run glottal_timing_EGG_trace.praat to extract information about timing of Lx signal maxima relative to segment-level landmarks, as well as time-normalized EGG traces.

(10) Proceed to statistical analysis (Relativized Standard Deviation and SSANOVA/loess) in R.

  - For visualizing EGG trajectories: SSANOVA with an overlaid density plot showing the (time-normalized) position of releases for each segment. That way you can see how the distribution of release points in oral signal aligns with EGG trajectories indicating changes in contact strength (and/or vertical movement).
  
     * As scripts are currently written, this will probably involve coordinating output from two different .txt files using token codes as a way of merging timing data vs. EGG trace data. Note that both outputs of glottal_timing_EGG_trace.praat involve time-normalization of the same segments.

(11) See if you can just call all of these dumb scripts directly through R?
